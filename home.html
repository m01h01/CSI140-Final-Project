                <h2>Recognizing the need For Treatment</h2>
                <p>We understand that mental health is a long-ignored component of our overall wellness. Unlike a physical problem that leads us to receive medical care, an individual with a mental health diagnosis, such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, or depression, cannot simply go in, take a blood test and receive a diagnosis. 
                    Moreover, the symptoms for a mental health diagnosis have a series of compounding variables creating smoke screens, or alternate ideas about what might be going on for an individual. People can “mask” their symptoms for years if not decades in some cases. 
                    Unlike an injury, mental health is often invisible and not addressed until there has been some event or chronic issue creating debilitating problems in one’s life. The stigma regarding mental health still permeates, continuing to make it challenging for individuals to freely ask for help. 
                    The threat of being perceived as “sick” or criticized for not managing one’s emotions better, further leads individuals to hide what is really going on.
